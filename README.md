# Yosuga no Sora Patch Conversion
This program was created to convert the older versions of Yosuga no Sora and Haruka na Sora based on the EntisGLS Engine to the newer format based on the KiriKiri Engine.

This entire process is detailed in the [wiki](https://github.com/TheRealMrWicked/Yosuga-no-Sora-Patch-Conversion/wiki/Yosuga-no-Sora-Patch-Conversion).

The English patch for Yosuga no Sora can be found in the English YNS [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/zTnGA5p). I am very active in the discord server but I can also be directly messaged on Discord at MrWicked#5113.



# Instructions
Step 1 - Download the latest program [release](https://github.com/TheRealMrWicked/Yosuga-no-Sora-Patch-Conversion/releases) and a yosuga.csx or Haruka.csx file from somewhere online (such as a translation group).
 
Step 2 - Extract the downloaded zip into a folder and then place the .csx file into that folder.

Step 3 - Double click the patchconvertor.exe file, if the program gives you the warning "Windows protected your PC" simply ignore and click run anyway.

Step 4 - Place the newly created patch.xp3 file into the Yosuga no Sora/Haruka na Sora game folder and run the game.

**DO NOT report translation errors in the text to me, that data comes from the .csx filed you supplied.**
