# Yosuga no Sora Patch Conversion
This program was created to convert the older versions of Yosuga no Sora and Haruka na Sora based on the EntisGLS Engine to the newer format based on the KiriKiri Engine.

This entire process is detailed in the [wiki](https://github.com/TheRealMrWicked/Yosuga-no-Sora-Patch-Conversion/wiki/Yosuga-no-Sora-Patch-Conversion).

The English patch for Yosuga no Sora can be found in the English YNS [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/zTnGA5p). I am very active in the discord server but I can also be directly messaged on Discord at MrWicked#5113.

# Usage
Step 1 - Download the latest program [release](https://github.com/TheRealMrWicked/Yosuga-no-Sora-Patch-Conversion/releases), [GARbro](https://github.com/TheRealMrWicked/Yosuga-no-Sora-Patch-Conversion/wiki/Patch-Conversion-Information#decrypting-the-xp3-file) and a yosuga.csx or Haruka.csx file from somewhere online (such as a translation group).
 
Step 2 - Extract the downloaded zip into a folder and then place the .csx file into that folder.

Step 3 - Double click the converter.exe file, if the program gives you the warning "Windows protected your PC" simply ignore and click run anyway.

Step 4 - When the program launches, if you have multiple ".csx" files in the same directory as the program executable, it will ask you to choose a game, select the respective one you want to convert.

Step 5 - Open the "compile" folder with GARbro and re-encrypt the files into a new data.xp3 by following the steps listed [here](https://github.com/TheRealMrWicked/Yosuga-no-Sora-Patch-Conversion/wiki/Patch-Conversion-Information/#encrypting-the-xp3-file).

Step 6 - Place the newly created data.xp3 file into the Yosuga no Sora/Haruka na Sora game folder and run the game.

**DO NOT report translation errors in the text to me, that data comes from the .csx filed you supplied.**
