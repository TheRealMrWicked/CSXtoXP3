# Yosuga no Sora Patch Conversion
This program was created to convert the older versions of Yosuga no Sora and Haruka na Sora based on the EntisGLS Engine to the newer format based on the KiriKiri Engine.

In order to carry out the conversion, files need to be prepared in a certain way, this entire process is detailed in the [wiki](https://github.com/TheRealMrWicked/Yosuga-no-Sora-Patch-Conversion/wiki/Yosuga-no-Sora-Patch-Conversion).

The English patch for Yosuga no Sora can be found in the YNS [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/zTnGA5p). I am very active in the discord server but I can also be directly messaged on Discord at MrWicked#5113.
